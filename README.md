# Curacao

An open-source toolkit for building REST/HTTP-based integration layers on top of asynchronous Servlet's.

## Introduction

Writing comprehensive documentation is hard, but a reasonable introduction to Curacao can be found here <a href="http://mark.koli.ch/introducing-curacao">http://mark.koli.ch/introducing-curacao</a>.

As the project matures, I intend to write out more documentation.

## Latest Version

See the [Releases page](https://github.com/markkolich/curacao/releases) to find the latest version.

## Examples

Working examples that demonstrate Curacao's flexibility can be found in the [curacao-examples project](https://github.com/markkolich/curacao/tree/master/curacao-examples/src/main/java/com/kolich/curacao/examples).

In the spirit of "eating my own dog food", [my own blog is built on Curacao and is fully open source on GitHub](https://github.com/markkolich/blog).  If you're looking for more complex component definitions, and realistic request mapping and response handling examples, the application source of my blog will be a great start.
  
Additionally, the [havalo-kvs project](https://github.com/markkolich/havalo-kvs) uses Curacao exclusively.
